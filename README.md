# SimpleSpark

This is a small tool that allows you to spin up and down a simple spark
cluster.

## Requirements

You need to have the following already setup on your box to use this:
* docker
* docker-compose
* docker-machine
* awscli (with basically full EC2 permissions)


## Acknowledgements

The first version of this little tool began with [this lovely Medium post](https://medium.com/@daviws/a-swarm-of-sparks-8f5a4afc72cc#.pt5f7h7c7) by Davi de Castro Reis at [WorldSense](https://www.worldsense.com).
